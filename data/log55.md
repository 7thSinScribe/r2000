PERSONAL LOG - SATURDAY #55 - AUTHOR [REDACTED]

Ugh. So yeah, another Saturday, whatever. Time is fake and everything feels like it’s stuck buffering on a dial-up connection. I had a thought earlier but I forgot it while burning a mix CD—probably wasn’t important. Anyway, welcome to my twisted little corner of the internet. This log is basically my away message to the void. If you’re reading this, congrats: you’ve officially entered my LiveJournal era. Mood: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ | Current Music: Linkin Park on loop.
