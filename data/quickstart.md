ROGUE 2000: QUICK-START RULES

`SYSTEM LOADING... WELCOME TO SATURDAY, JANUARY 1ST, 2000.` `THIS IS QUICK-START PROTOCOL 12,957.5`

THE SETTING

It's been January 1st, 2000 for nearly 13,000 Saturdays. The digital apocalypse merged the colonial fantasy world of Rogue 2000 with reality when the game launched at midnight on NYE 1999. Now, survivors navigate a world where game entities believe they're real, reality glitches like bad code, and the Gamemaster is always watching.

THE P.O.W.E.R. SYSTEM

All entities are defined by five fundamental attributes:

P - POWER: Raw physical strength and destructive capability.

O - ODDITY: Unconventional thinking and approach to problems.

W - WISDOM: Problem-solving, technical knowledge, and strategy.

E - ENDURANCE: Physical toughness and resilience.

R - REFLEX: Speed, coordination, and reaction time.

CHARACTER CREATION

1. DISTRIBUTE ATTRIBUTE POINTS

Choose one method:

Standard (15 points): Distribute 15 points among the five attributes

Gritty (12 points): For vulnerable characters who must rely on teamwork

Heroic (18 points): For exceptional characters

Requirements:

Minimum 1 in each attribute

Maximum 5 in any attribute at creation

2. CALCULATE DERIVED ATTRIBUTES

BLOOD (Health) = Power + Endurance

SWEAT (Stamina) = Endurance + Reflex

TEARS (Mental) = Wisdom + Oddity

POWER LEVEL = Sum of the five core attributes (P + O + W + E + R) × 100

3. STATE OF BEING

In this quick-start version, all player characters are Physical:

You interact with physical space

You cause and receive physical damage

You are immune to digital damage (but your technology isn't)

You are visible in the real world

THE DICE SYSTEM

DICE MECHANICS

Each attribute provides d6s equal to its rating (1-5)

All attributes start with d6s as their base die type

Attributes above 5 upgrade dice rather than adding more

Upgrade path: d6 → d7 → d8 → d10 → d12 → d14 → d16

POKER DICE SYSTEM

1. BUILD YOUR DICE POOL

Draw 7 dice from your attribute dice + equipment + allies

Roll them secretly

2. PLAYING YOUR HAND

On your turn, draw 1 new die

For actions, play 3 dice from your hand

Declare their values (can lie about them)

Describe your action

At the END of your turn, discard down to 7 dice if needed

3. RESOLUTION

The Gamemaster reveals 3 opposition dice

The Gamemaster may challenge your declared values

If challenged, GM reveals their dice FIRST, then you reveal yours

Resolution is based on the actual revealed dice

4. HAND RANKINGS

Three of a Kind: Three dice showing the same number (higher number wins ties)

Straight: Three sequential numbers (higher top number wins ties)

Pair + High: Two dice showing the same number, plus one other (higher pair wins ties, then higher odd die)

High Total: Highest sum of three dice (larger die type breaks ties)

5. TIE BREAKING

If identical combinations, highest value in the combination wins

If still tied, largest die type wins (d12 > d10 > d8 > d6)

If completely unbreakable tie, player wins

THE CHEATING GAMEMASTER

The Gamemaster doesn't roll dice randomly. Instead:

Creates a fixed pool at the start of each scene (5 dice per player + drama modifier)

Assigns values to these dice (30% low, 40% medium, 20% high, 10% critical)

Must choose when to challenge player bluffs

Once dice are used, they're gone for the scene

PROGRESSION

Characters improve through:

Equipment acquisition (better dice)

Ally development

Learning from failure (accumulate failures to gain attribute improvements)

Attribute dice upgrades (when exceeding 5)

LEARNING FROM FAILURE

As you fail at challenges, you grow stronger:

Keep a tally of failures for each attribute

After 5 tallies (quickstart default), gain a +1 to that attribute and reset the tally

Record failures specific to the attribute used (Power failures improve Power, etc.)

Harder challenges may count as multiple tallies (GM's discretion)
