# ROGUE 2000: QUICKSTART RULES

## THE SETTING

It's been January 1st, 2000 for nearly 13,000 Saturdays. The digital apocalypse merged the colonial fantasy world of Rogue 2000 with reality when the game launched at midnight on NYE 1999. Now, survivors navigate a world where:

- Digital devices display the date as January 1, 2000, though analog calendars track actual dates
- Game entities believe they're real, wandering the physical world
- Reality glitches like bad code, with digital decay visible everywhere
- The mysterious Gamemaster is always watching

## THE P.O.W.E.R. SYSTEM

All entities are defined by five fundamental attributes:

**P - POWER**: Raw physical strength and destructive capability.  
**O - ODDITY**: Unconventional thinking and approach to problems.  
**W - WISDOM**: Problem-solving, technical knowledge, and strategy.  
**E - ENDURANCE**: Physical toughness and resilience.  
**R - REFLEX**: Speed, coordination, and reaction time.  

Attributes are rated from 1-35. Each attribute provides d6s equal to its rating for the first five levels.  
Attributes above 5 upgrade dice, at a 1 for 1 ratio, so at power 6, you would have 1d7/4d6, and at power 7, you would have access 2d7/3d6.  
Upgrade path: d6 → d7 → d8 → d10 → d12 → d14 → d16

## CHARACTER CREATION

### 1. DISTRIBUTE ATTRIBUTE POINTS

Choose one method:
- **Standard** (10 points): The intended start. 
- **Weaklings** (8 points): For vulnerable characters who must rely on teamwork, or groups of more than 3.
- **Grown-ups** (12 points): For slightly more, or groups of less than 3.

Maximum 5 in any attribute at character creation

### 2. CALCULATE DERIVED ATTRIBUTES

- **BLOOD** = 5 + Power + Endurance
- **SWEAT** = 2 + Endurance + Reflex
- **TEARS** = 1 + Wisdom + Oddity
- **POWER LEVEL** = Sum of the five core attributes (P + O + W + E + R) × 100

### 3. STATE OF BEING

In this quick-start, all player characters begin as pure Physical:
- You interact with physical space unassisted
- You cause and receive physical damage
- You are immune to digital damage (but your technology isn't)

## SCENES

### POKER DICE SYSTEM

#### 1. BUILD YOUR HAND

- Roll 7 dice from attribute dice + equipment + allies
- The dice available to draw depend on the context
  - Social = ODDITY, WISDOM
  - Exploration = WISDOM, ENDURANCE
  - Combat = POWER, REFLEX (when in combat, also draw 1 weapon die in addition to an attribute die)
- Roll them secretly

#### 2. PLAYING YOUR HAND

- On your turn, draw 1 new die
- For actions, play 3 dice from your hand
- Declare their values (can lie about them)
- Describe your action
- At the END of your turn, discard down to 7 dice if needed

#### 3. RESOLUTION

- The Gamemaster reveals 3 opposition dice, from NPCs or the environment
- GM reveals their dice FIRST, then you reveal yours
- Resolution is based on rankings of the revealed dice

#### 4. HAND RANKINGS

- **Three of a Kind**: Three dice showing the same number (higher number wins ties)
- **Straight**: Three sequential numbers (higher top number wins ties)
- **Pair + High**: Two dice showing the same number, plus one other (higher pair wins ties, then higher odd die)
- **High Total**: Highest sum of three dice (larger die type breaks ties)

#### 5. TIE BREAKING

- If completely unbreakable tie, player wins

### LEARNING FROM FAILURE

As you fail at challenges, you grow stronger:
- Keep track of XP for each attribute
- After 5 XP (quickstart default), gain a +1 to that attribute and reset the XP
- Record XP specific to the attribute used (Power failures earn Power XP, etc.)
- Harder challenges may award multiple XP (GM's discretion)
