# ROGUE 2000: QUICKSTART RULES

## THE SETTING

It's been January 1st, 2000 for nearly 13,000 Saturdays. The digital apocalypse merged the colonial fantasy world of Rogue 2000 with reality when the game launched at midnight on NYE 1999. Now, survivors navigate a world where:

- Digital devices display the date as January 1, 2000 due to a bug in the original game
- Game entities believe they're real, wandering the physical world
- The Gamemaster is always watching

# THE P.O.W.E.R. SYSTEM

Post-merge, all entities are governed by the five fundamental statistics:

**P - POWER**: Raw physical strength and destructive capability.  

**O - ODDITY**: Unconventional thinking and approach to problems.  

**W - WISDOM**: Problem-solving, technical knowledge, and strategy.  

**E - ENDURANCE**: Physical toughness and resilience.  

**R - REFLEX**: Speed, coordination, and reaction time.  

Stats are rated from 1-35. 

Stats provide d6 equal to their rating for the first five levels.  

Stats above 5 upgrade dice, at a 1:1 ratio, so at power 6, you would have 1d7/4d6, and at power 7, you would have access to 2d7/3d6. 

Upgrade path: d6 → d7 → d8 → d10 → d12 → d14 → d16

### THE DERIVED ATTRIBUTES

Like many RPGs of the time, Rogue 2000 used derived attributes, calculated & updated based on your **POWER** stats. 

### **BLOOD**

> The last analogue interface.

Run out of this stuff and you don't need to question what happens, because you won't be able to ask any questions. 

It's calculated based off of your **POWER & ENDURANCE**, plus a base number for your entityType, for humans, that's 3. 

# CHARACTER CREATION
In this quickstart, character creation is heavily streamlined. 

### 1. DISTRIBUTE ATTRIBUTE POINTS

Choose one method for all players:
- **Standard** (10 points): The intended start for a group of 3 players. 
- **Weaklings** (7 points): For vulnerable characters who must rely on teamwork, or groups of more than 3.
- **Lone Wolves** (12 points): A little boost, or groups of less than 3.

Maximum 5 in any attribute at character creation

### 2. CALCULATE DERIVED ATTRIBUTES

- **BLOOD** = 3 + Power + Endurance
- **SWEAT** = 2 + Endurance + Reflex
- **TEARS** = 1 + Wisdom + Oddity
- **POWER LEVEL** = Sum of the five core attributes (P + O + W + E + R) × 100

### 3. STATE OF BEING

In this quick-start, all player characters begin as Physical entities:
- You interact with physical space unassisted
- You are immune to digital damage (but your technology isn't)
- You cannot perceive or interact with purely digital entities unassisted

## SCENES

A scene is a nebulous amount of time, containing an indeterminate amount of turns. 

At the start of a new scene, you'll Build a Hand of dice & proceed to play a poker-like game against an AI opponent who isn't playing by the same rules; The Gamemaster. 

### SCENE START

#### 1. BUILD YOUR HAND

- Roll 7 dice from attribute dice + equipment + allies
- The dice available to draw depend on the context
  - Social = ODDITY, WISDOM
  - Exploration = WISDOM, ENDURANCE
  - Combat = POWER, REFLEX
- Roll them secretly

#### 2. PLAYING YOUR HAND

- On your turn, draw 1 attribute die. In combat, additionally draw 1 weapon die per turn. 
- For major actions, play 3 dice from your hand
- Declare their values (can lie about them)
- Describe your action(s)
- You may declare an action (putting forth dice with hidden values) to trigger after your turn, or upon a trigger, such as "When that guy tries to hit me, I'll smash his face in"
- At the END of your turn, discard down to 7 dice if needed

#### 3. RESOLUTION

- If an entity or obstacle stands in your way, The Gamemaster reveals 3 opposition dice.
- GM reveals their dice FIRST, then you reveal yours
- Resolution is based on rankings of the revealed dice. 

#### 4. HAND RANKINGS

- **Three of a Kind**: Three dice showing the same number (higher number wins ties)
- **Straight**: Three sequential numbers (higher top number wins ties)
- **Pair + High**: Two dice showing the same number, plus one other (higher pair wins ties, then higher odd die)
- **High Total**: Highest sum of three dice (larger die type breaks ties)

#### 5. TIE BREAKING

- If completely unbreakable tie, player wins

### LEARNING FROM FAILURE

As you fail at challenges, you grow stronger:
- Keep track of XP for each attribute
- After 5 XP (quickstart default), gain a +1 to that attribute and reset the XP
- Record XP specific to the attribute used (Power failures earn Power XP, etc.)
- Harder challenges may award multiple XP (GM's discretion)
