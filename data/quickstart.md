# ROGUE 2000: QUICKSTART RULES

These are unfinished prototype quickstart rules to the tabletop roleplaying game Rogue 2000, all rights reserved.


## SURVIVOR BASICS

Listen up, newbie. If you're reading this and somehow don't know what happened to the world, you've either been in a coma or been too cozy behind EM shielding your whole life. 

Let me get you up to speed before you get yourself duped. 

**THE ESSENTIAL FACTS:**

1.  It's been January 1st, 2000 for approximately 13,000 Saturdays. Digital devices are stuck there. Don't bother trying to fix them. Keep a calendar or ask a Timekeeper. 
2.  The Rogueboy 2000 and its "revolutionary AI-powered RPG" Rogue 2000 launched at midnight on NYE 1999. Instead of just displaying games through AR goggles, it merged its mythological fantasy world with ours.
3.  Reality now runs on the P.O.W.E.R. system. Yes, like a game. Deal with it.
4.  Everything exists in one of three states:
    -   **PHYSICAL**: Normal stuff. Can be touched, punched, broken.
    -   **DIGITAL**: Game entities, data ghosts, etc. Invisible without tech, immune to physical attacks.
    -   **HYBRID**: The worst of both worlds. Physical presence with digital properties. Yes, some people are becoming hybrid. No, we don't know if it's reversible.
5.  When you leave the Havens, the Gamemaster is always watching. 

This terminal you're using? It's running SurvivorOS, a homebrew operating system I distributed across all surviving Rogueboy units. 

Learn the system. Roll the dice. Stay alive.

And for God's sake, don't try to "win." There is no win condition, I tried.

# THE P.O.W.E.R. SYSTEM

Post-merge, all entities are governed by the big five:

**P - POWER**: Raw physical strength and destructive capability.  

**O - ODDITY**: Unconventional thinking and approach to problems.  

**W - WISDOM**: Problem-solving, technical knowledge, and strategy.  

**E - ENDURANCE**: Physical toughness and resilience.  

**R - REFLEX**: Speed, coordination, and reaction time.  

Stats are rated from **1 - 35** 

Stats provide d6 equal to their rating for the first five levels.  

Stats above 5 upgrade dice, at a **1:1 ratio**

At power 6, you would have 1d7/4d6, and at power 7, you would have access to 2d7/3d6. 

**Upgrade path**: d6 → d7 → d8 → d10 → d12 → d14 → d16

### THE DERIVED ATTRIBUTES

Like many RPGs of the time, Rogue 2000 used derived stats, calculated & updated based on your **POWER** stats. 

### **BLOOD**

> The last analogue interface.

Run out of this stuff and you don't need to question what happens, type outofblood into the terminal if you're curious. 

It's calculated based off of your **POWER & ENDURANCE**, plus a base number for your entityType, for us humans, that's 3. 

Blood regenerates very slowly, ticking up by 1 per flip. (day)


### SWEAT

> It's almost a prerequisite to life's greatest pleasures. Like, being alive.

Calculated based off of your **ENDURANCE & REFLEX**, plus a base number of 2 for humans.

Spend **SWEAT** at a **1:1** ratio to **draw POWER, ENDURANCE or  REFLEX dice** or to **dodge**.

Just be prepared to actually sweat, 

**SWEAT** regenerates 1 point per 0.5 liters of water consumed, 4 points for a hearty meal, and fills to half its maximum when you sleep for 8 hours or more. 

### TEARS
> Don't waste too much salt. 

Calculated based off of your **WISDOM & ODDITY**, plus a base number of 1 for humans.

# CHARACTER CREATION

In this quickstart, character creation is heavily streamlined. 

### 1. DISTRIBUTE ATTRIBUTE POINTS

Choose one method for all players:
- **Standard** (10 points): The intended start for a group of 3 players. 
- **Weaklings** (7 points): For vulnerable characters who must rely on teamwork, or groups of more than 3.
- **Lone Wolves** (12 points): A little boost, or groups of less than 3.

Maximum 5 in any attribute at character creation

### 2. CALCULATE DERIVED ATTRIBUTES

- **BLOOD** = 3 + Power + Endurance
- **SWEAT** = 2 + Endurance + Reflex
- **TEARS** = 1 + Wisdom + Oddity
- **POWER LEVEL** = Sum of the five core attributes (P + O + W + E + R) × 100

### 3. STATE OF BEING

In this quick-start, all player characters begin as Physical entities:
- You interact with physical space unassisted
- You are immune to digital damage (but your technology isn't)
- You cannot perceive or interact with purely digital entities unassisted

## SCENES

A scene is a nebulous amount of time, containing an indeterminate amount of turns. 

At the start of a new scene, you'll Build a Hand of dice & proceed to play a poker-like game against an The Gamemaster who isn't playing by the same rules. 

A scene is always afoot & it's always someone, or *something's* turn. 


### SCENE START

#### 1. BUILD YOUR HAND

-   Draw 7 dice from Approach + equipment + allies
-   Your Approach guides which P.O.W.E.R dice you can draw:
    -   **COMBAT APPROACHES**
        -   FORCE: POWER + REFLEX (direct attacks)
        -   TACTICS: WISDOM + REFLEX (strategy, precision)
        -   DECEPTION: ODDITY + REFLEX (unpredictable moves)
    -   **SOCIAL APPROACHES**
        -   INFLUENCE: ODDITY + WISDOM (persuasion)
        -   PRESENCE: POWER + ODDITY (intimidation)
        -   INSIGHT: WISDOM + ENDURANCE (understanding)
    -   **EXPLORATION APPROACHES**
        -   INVESTIGATION: WISDOM + ENDURANCE (methodical)
        -   INSTINCT: ODDITY + REFLEX (gut feelings, vibes, tingles)
        -   BRUTE FORCE: POWER + ENDURANCE (hard)
-   **CORE DICE REQUIREMENTS**
    -   Attacks must include at least one POWER or REFLEX die, plus one WEAPON die
    -   Social influence requires at least one ODDITY or WISDOM die
    -   Physical obstacles require at least one POWER or ENDURANCE die
-   You can always attempt to draw from non-standard attributes by describing your approach

#### 2. YOUR TURN

- At the start of your turn, draw 2 P.O.W.E.R dice. In combat, additionally draw 1 weapon die. 
- For major actions, play 3 dice from your hand
- Take up to three minor actions (move 10 ft, draw a weapon, drink Slurrp)
- Describe your action(s)
- You may declare an action (putting forth dice with hidden values) to trigger after your turn, or upon a trigger, such as "When that guy tries to hit me, I'll smash his face in" setting the dice aside, hidden, like a trap. 
- At the END of your turn, discard down to 7 dice if needed

#### 3. RESOLUTION

- If an entity or obstacle stands in your way, The Gamemaster reveals 3 opposition dice.
- GM reveals their dice FIRST, then you reveal yours
- Resolution is based on rankings of the revealed dice. 

#### 4. HAND RANKINGS

- **Three of a Kind**: Three dice showing the same number (higher number wins ties)
- **Straight**: Three sequential numbers (higher top number wins ties)
- **Pair + High**: Two dice showing the same number, plus one other (higher pair wins ties, then higher odd die)
- **High Total**: Highest sum of three dice (larger die type breaks ties)

#### 5. TIE BREAKING

- If completely unbreakable tie, player wins
