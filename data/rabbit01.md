title: First Contact Protocols (Found in Storage Unit 7)
---

> PERSONAL LOG - SATURDAY #8,472

Found something impossible today. Was digging through abandoned Storage Unit 7 in old N-Co R&D wing. Hidden behind some dev kits was a sealed case with a document from 1964 marked "CONTINGENCY: FIRST CONTACT PROTOCOLS."

Why the hell would a toy company have first contact protocols in the 1960s? This was years before they even made their first game console. The document details procedures for "non-terrestrial entity interaction" and has sections on "linguistic bootstrap algorithms" and "consciousness mapping."

The procedures themselves are fragmented - looks like I only have part of it. But what's here is... advanced. Too advanced for the 60s. Some of these concepts weren't even theoretical until the 90s.

The Gamemaster algorithms... there are similarities in the fundamental approach. I need to find the rest of this document.
