Nearly lost it today. Was rummaging through an abandoned N-Co shop when my torch died. Just like that - full charge to nothing in seconds. Could have sworn I heard something moving, but couldn't see a bloody thing.

Then I remembered the RogueVision AR goggles I'd pocketed earlier. Put them on and there it was. A glowing blue... thing. Sort of like a jellyfish crossed with a lightning bolt. Some kind of pure digital entity, existing right there in physical space but completely invisible without the goggles.

It was draining the electricity from anything I had powered up. My watch stopped. Phone died. Even the little LED keychain went dark. Could actually see little streams of energy (the goggles visualize it as blue particles) flowing from my devices into the creature.

I panicked and chucked a spanner at it. Went straight through. No effect. Physical objects just pass right through digital entities - they don't exist on our physical plane, see? Tried punching it too - my hand passed right through, but I felt this weird tingle up my arm. Not painful, but not pleasant either.

Then it "attacked" me. No physical damage, but it sent this electrical pulse that locked up my muscles for about 5 seconds. Like being tased, but milder. Still terrifying when you can't move.

Finally figured out I could affect it by using other powered devices. Had an old taser in my pack - discharged it near the creature and it seemed to disrupt its form. Kept zapping until it dissipated entirely.

Key findings about pure digital entities:
- Invisible without AR glasses/goggles
- Can't physically touch or harm you
- Drain "Watts" from any powered device (measured the drain at about 10W/second)
- Can deliver stun attacks that temporarily paralyze
- Vulnerable to electrical surges, EM pulses, etc.
- No blood or physical components - just disrupt their pattern enough and they dissipate
