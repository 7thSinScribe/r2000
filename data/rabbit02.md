> PERSONAL LOG - SATURDAY #8,472

Been cross-referencing the Apollo mission patches I found in the CEO's old office with official NASA archives. There's a discrepancy. The N-Co versions have a small additional symbol - looks like their old logo before the corporate rebranding.

Found personnel records too. Three N-Co employees were "on loan" to NASA during Apollo 11. But their security clearances were higher than the NASA administrators.

The strangest part: recovered a partial transcript where Mission Control references "N-Co assets on the far side" during Apollo 11. What assets? Why the far side?

The public story about N-Co starting as a playing card company in the 70s is fiction. They were something else entirely before that.
